	<h2> Resident Assitant, UC Berkeley (August 2015 - Present):</h2>
	<p>I currently serve as a Resident Assistant, or RA, in the residence halls at UC Berkeley. As an RA, I spend 1-2 nights each week "on duty," serving as a first responder to urgent matters in the residence halls. I also program events for residents, and I work to support my residents academically and emotionally throughout their time in the residence halls. <br><br><br></p>

	<h2> Curriculum Developer, Teaching Privacy (February - August 2015):</h2>
	<p>The Teaching Privacy project seeks to provide people of the Digital Age with information about how websites gather and utilize data about users. The team is currently working on developing classroom curriculum so that students worldwide can learn about online privacy and safety. I wrote, reviewed, edited, and researched curriculum for the project. <a href="http://teachingprivacy.org/">View the Teaching Privacy project page.</a><br><br><br> </p>
